# FamixDiff: User documentation

FamixDiff allows one to compute the diff between two Moose models representing two different versions of the same project. It will return a report containing the different kind of changes that happened between those two versions. 
To detect entities that got renamed or moved in the project, we are using some heuristics that can be parametrized (See section [Customize the analysis](#customize-the-analysis)).
